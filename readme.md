## Welcome to my Scheduler Application
This application is designed to help the user organize their tasks/projects through time setters.

## More Deeply
The user will be able to create a category of their preference and make a list of projects within the set category, then followed up with any extra information.
All data is sent to an internal database and is formed to allow the user to create, read, update and delete any or all data.

The databases included are :
----------------------------
- Category Db
- Projects Db
- Inform Db

## Feature Expectancies
- Login Feature
- Filter for Projects
- Search Feature
- Sending emails to the user when their time is up
